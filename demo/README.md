**Demonstrating AI-Driven 6G Pipeline Orchestration**

## 1. Demonstration
In this demonstration, we explore how AI-driven orchestration can be used to deploy an AI model for identifying stray dogs using drone technology. The process involves intent parsing, model selection, service deployment, and network adaptation to optimize performance and efficiency.

## 2. Intent Parsing
Intent parsing is the first step where the system interprets the user's request. In this case, the user intended to deploy 10 drones to search for stray dogs on a university campus. To refine deployment specifications, the system queried key requirements such as:
- Maximum acceptable delay for video transmission
- Data transmission rate per drone
- Desired output format (e.g., GPS coordinates, images, video)

The user provided key constraints, stating a 1-2 second delay tolerance and 480p video transmission alongside GPS coordinates for alerting rescue teams. 

## 3. AI Model Selection
Once the intent was parsed, the orchestrator provided a list of AI models to choose from for object detection:

1. **microsoft/table-transformer-detection**
2. **microsoft/table-transformer-structure-recognition**
3. **facebook/detr-resnet-50**
4. **microsoft/table-transformer-structure-recognition-v1.1-all**
5. **TahaDouaji/detr-doc-table-detection**

The user selected **facebook/detr-resnet-50**, a model known for its effectiveness in object detection tasks, including identifying objects within images or video feeds.

## 4. Service Deployment
With the model selected, the system initially proposed **Cloud deployment**, as it provides scalable processing power and centralizes data management. However, the user suggested using **Edge deployment** instead, arguing that lower latency was crucial for real-time drone operations.

Upon confirmation, the system proceeded with deploying **facebook/detr-resnet-50** on the Edge. The entire 6G pipeline orchestration system was responsible for ensuring that the model was deployed in the selected Edge region. Additionally, it handled user access control through the **Policy Control Function (PCF)**, ensuring that only authorized users could access the model at the Edge. The system also allowed specific **User Equipment (UE)** to connect to the Edge infrastructure, making the deployed AI model application readily available for immediate use.

## 5. Network Adaptation
To ensure optimal performance, the orchestrator suggested using the **eMBB (Enhanced Mobile Broadband) network slice**, designed for high-bandwidth applications like video streaming and large-scale data transmission. This decision was based on:
- The requirement for 480p video and GPS data transmission
- The preference for Edge-based processing to minimize latency

Furthermore, the **selected Hugging Face model was automatically wrapped within a server** that was generated by the **Large Language Model (LLM)** within the pipeline. This AI-driven process ensured that the model was efficiently served to users with minimal manual intervention, streamlining deployment and service accessibility.

The **eMBB slice** was confirmed as the network selection, guaranteeing efficient data transfer with minimal disruptions.

## 6. Background Work of the 6G Pipeline
### Automatic Code Generation through LLM
A core function of the 6G pipeline is its ability to automatically generate necessary deployment and serving code through a **Large Language Model (LLM)**. When a user selects an AI model, the LLM creates a server wrapper around it, ensuring it can be efficiently deployed and accessed as a service. This eliminates the need for manual coding and accelerates model deployment, reducing the time required for operational readiness.

### Allowing UE Access to Edge and Interaction with OpenAir Interface Stack
To ensure the deployed model is accessible to authorized users, the pipeline interacts with the **OpenAir Interface (OAI) stack**. This integration allows specific **User Equipment (UE)** to connect to the Edge infrastructure dynamically. The **Policy Control Function (PCF)** manages these access permissions, ensuring that only verified users and devices can interact with the deployed AI model. By leveraging the OAI stack, the pipeline enhances network adaptability and ensures secure, high-performance communication between users and Edge-hosted AI applications.

## Conclusion
This demonstration highlights the capabilities of AI-driven 6G pipeline orchestration, allowing users to dynamically deploy AI models while optimizing deployment environments and network resources. The orchestration pipeline not only deploys the model but also manages user access and enables seamless Edge connectivity. By leveraging intelligent orchestration, drone-based AI applications can be efficiently managed, ensuring seamless and scalable real-world deployments.
